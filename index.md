**My projects on github.com are as followed:**

<br/>**NOTE:** All of my projects are available on [my Github account](https://github.com/bseyfi) as soon as they release or update. Some info and introduction of projects are available on  [my Github pages](https://bseyfi.github.io) also.

### [1. Bicolor image compression protocol for embedded systems](https://github.com/BSeyfi/bicolor-image-compression-protocol-for-embedded-systems)
This is compression method for bicolor images suitable for small images to use in embedded systems. This protocol is made from scratch.
###### <br />*It would be available on Github in very near future.*

### [2. LCD Nokia 5110/3310 driver for STM32F103 ARM microcontroller](https://github.com/BSeyfi/LCD-5110-driver)
This is a driver for Nokia 5110 or Nokia 3310 LCD's based on PCD8544 LCD controller designed for STM32F103 ARM microcontrollers. It should work for all STM32F1xx and also for almost all STM32 ARM microcontrollers with or without any modification. <br/> This driver is simple and fast. It's designed to recognize and use compressed images that are compressed with [bicolor image compression protocol](https://github.com/BSeyfi/bicolor-image-compression-protocol-for-embedded-systems) also.
###### <br />*It would be available on Github in very near future.*

### [3. BICTES](https://github.com/BSeyfi/BICTES)
BICTES is freeware tool to compress images with regard to [bicolor image compression protocol for embedded systems](https://github.com/BSeyfi/bicolor-image-compression-protocol-for-embedded-systems). It is also converts non 1-bit bitmaps like colorful or grayscaled images to 1-bit bitmap images. PNG, JPG and BMP files are supported. BICTES convert image to an array of bytes in C language syntax. It can produces three type of arrays:
  1. uncompressed image array
  2. compressed image array
  3. compressed image with padding data
